# DSA

Day1 = learn the problem solving approach and the requiremets of dsa.we write optimized code so that time required to run the code will get less 

Day2 = learn how  the square root funtion works and find square root without functions first use brute force approach and then try to optimized it and then 
       get the optimized solution
